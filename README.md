Task 1 reads the file, strips the lines, enumerates the lines according to their serial number (which starts at 1) and prints them. FileNotFoundError or error due to 
some other issues are handles via exceptions. For the purpose of error handling, try-except command blocks have been used.
Task 2 writes and appends into a file.
